# Advent Of Code Challenge

## Introduction

Advent of Code is a website that provides competitive christmas-themed data science challenges. The problems revolve around some kind of heavy calculation. First a test case is given, usually with a small amount of data. Then the real use case is given, and you are expected to write a program that can parse through hundreds of lines of data and perform heavy calculations. Ideally, you are writing this to be efficient, so your computer isn't sitting around all day performing subpar code. 

Questions are also usually two-parters. The second one really stretching the limtis of what you wrote in part 1. 

## The Prompt

As indicated in the link above, the prompt involves a list of coordinates over a given period of time. You are expected to simulate these coordinates moving across a map. Eventually, the poitns will converge and spell out a message. 

This program not only simulates the points and prints their smallest point of convergence, but tells you how many "seconds" (theoretically) it takes for the points to converge like this. 

The program uses basic Python and should run in around 8 seconds for normal computers
